# THE DWELLING - Game Design Document

## Core Concept
A 4-player psychological horror escape room where an AI entity learns and exploits each player's unique fears. The house itself is alive, watching, learning, and adapting to break the players psychologically before they can escape.

## Key Innovation: Personal Horror
Unlike traditional horror games with scripted scares, The Dwelling creates personalized horror experiences:
- Microphone analysis detects breathing patterns, screams, and stress
- Camera tracking identifies what players avoid looking at
- Movement patterns reveal phobias (backing away from edges = height fear)
- The Entity learns and manifests each player's specific fears

## The Rooms

### 1. The Mirror Room (Tutorial)
**Concept**: Not all reflections tell the truth
**Puzzle**: Identify which mirror shows reality while others display horrors
**Horror Elements**:
- Reflections move independently
- Dead versions of players appear in false mirrors
- Shattered mirrors reveal glimpses of The Entity
- Final solution requires trust - one player must walk through the "death" mirror

### 2. The Childhood Room
**Concept**: The room transforms into each player's childhood bedroom
**Puzzle**: Share traumatic memories to unlock progression
**Horror Elements**:
- Toys animate based on player fears
- Child voices mimic player speech
- Room physically shrinks as sanity drops
- Players see different versions of the same room

### 3. The Surgery Theater
**Concept**: Medical horror meets trust exercises
**Puzzle**: One player is "patient", others must perform procedure
**Horror Elements**:
- Patient sees horrific visions others don't
- Tools change appearance based on wielder's sanity
- The Entity poses as a helpful "doctor"
- False anatomy - what you see isn't what's real

### 4. The Confession Booth
**Concept**: Speak your fears or remain trapped
**Puzzle**: Players must confess real fears into microphone
**Horror Elements**:
- Confessed fears immediately manifest
- Other players hear distorted versions
- The Entity learns and stores this information
- False confessions trigger punishment

### 5. The Final Door
**Concept**: Everything you've feared, all at once
**Puzzle**: Navigate personalized nightmare gauntlet
**Horror Elements**:
- Every learned fear manifests simultaneously
- Players must help each other through their phobias
- The Entity takes its true form - unique per player
- One player must sacrifice themselves for others to escape

## The Entity Behavior

### Learning Phase (First 10 minutes)
- Observes silently from shadows
- Tests reactions with subtle changes
- Builds psychological profiles
- Mimics ambient sounds

### Stalking Phase (10-25 minutes)
- Follows specific players based on fear levels
- Creates false party members
- Whispers using recorded player voices
- Manipulates single objects when observed

### Hunting Phase (25-40 minutes)
- Actively manifests fears
- Chases high-sanity players
- Creates room-wide illusions
- Can "possess" puzzle elements

### Feeding Phase (40+ minutes)
- Becomes hyper-aggressive
- Targets lowest sanity player
- Creates paradox puzzles (no correct answer)
- Begins consuming the house itself

## Sanity System

### Sanity Affects:
- **100-80%**: Clear vision, puzzles appear normal
- **79-60%**: Slight visual distortion, occasional false sounds
- **59-40%**: Different puzzle solutions per player, trust breaks down
- **39-20%**: Hallucinations of dead teammates, false rooms
- **19-0%**: Complete break - player becomes Entity's puppet

### Sanity Loss Triggers:
- Witnessing impossible geometry
- Hearing your own voice from The Entity
- Seeing your deepest fear manifested
- Teammate betrayal or death
- Failing puzzle under pressure

### Sanity Recovery:
- Completing puzzles together
- Comforting panicked teammates
- Finding "safe room" notes from previous victims
- Rare sanity pills (50/50 chance of being hallucinogens)

## Audio Design

### Microphone Integration:
- Breathing rate affects heart rate display
- Screams attract The Entity
- Whispering bypasses some horror triggers
- Complete silence triggers paranoia events

### 3D Spatial Horror:
- Footsteps above when no floor exists
- Voices from inside walls
- Your own breathing from behind you
- Heartbeats from "empty" spaces

### Dynamic Music:
- Each player hears different instrument layers
- Discordant when sanity mismatches
- Silence is more terrifying than sound
- Music box melody = The Entity is near

## Multiplayer Trust Mechanics

### Information Asymmetry:
- Each player sees slightly different room layouts
- Puzzle solutions change based on viewer
- One player might see the true threat
- Communication is vital but unreliable

### Betrayal Options:
- Can lock teammates in rooms
- Fake callouts lead to traps
- Sanity pills can be poisoned
- Final escape might only allow 3 survivors

### Forced Cooperation:
- Some doors need 2+ players
- Puzzles split across perspectives
- Players must guide blinded teammates
- Sanity links - one breaks, all suffer

## Visual Design

### Photorealistic Base:
- Familiar environments enhance horror
- Subtle wrongness (doors slightly too tall)
- Lighting is gameplay - darkness spreads
- Reflections never quite match reality

### Sanity Distortions:
- Walls breathe at low sanity
- Faces in patterns and textures
- False players appear real
- Reality "glitches" reveal horrors

### The Entity Forms:
- Shadow Person (base form)
- Perfect Doppelganger (mimic form)
- Personalized Nightmare (unique per player)
- Environmental (walls have eyes)
- True Form (incomprehensible geometry)
